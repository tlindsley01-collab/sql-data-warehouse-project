# sql-data-warehouse-project

Welcome to my **sql-data-warehouse-project** repository!

This project was my first attempt at building a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights.  Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights what I have learned by applying common, foundational practices in data engineering and analytics.

## Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications

- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.

## About Me

Hi there!  I'm Tom.  I am a non-technical IT Strategy Consultant (as of 2025) with over 10 years of experience.  I am on a journey to shift away from the world of high-level, conceptual IT strategy and into a new path in which I have deep technical expertise in data engineering, analytics, and data architecture.  This is my first step.
