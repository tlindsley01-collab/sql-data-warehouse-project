# :rocket: sql-data-warehouse-project

Welcome to my **sql-data-warehouse-project** repository!

This project was my first attempt at learning SQL and building a data warehouse via an online course delivered by Baraa Khatib Salkini (AKA DataWithBaraa). Not only is this my first attempt at SQL and data warehouse fundamentals....it is also my first time working in Git and building a repo.

This project serves as the first portfolio project entry in Git and it highlights what I  learned.

I fully documented each step of the entire project.  If you're looking for good toilet reading --> **[TEST]**

I strongly recommend checking out Baraa's Git page and exploring some of his courses --> **[DataWithBaraa](https://github.com/DataWithBaraa)**

## About Me

Hi there!  I'm Tom.  I am a non-technical IT Strategy Consultant (as of 2025) with over 10 years of experience.  I am on a journey to shift away from the world of high-level, conceptual IT strategy and into a new path in which I have deep technical expertise in data engineering, analytics, and data architecture.  This is my first step.
